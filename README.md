This app has been scripted using React and deployed on Firebase

Built a burger building application that mimics a portion of how a real world food delivery application works, where we can dynamically build a burger, add ingredients and then in the end of course also purchase it.

Multiple user sign-up & sign-in authentication features have been added along with order history for individual users that are fetched from a remote server (i.e. Firebase).

Sign-up for free and order your favourite burger right now!
